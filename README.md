# Model Optimization for Faster Inference Deployment

## Overview
This repository provides tools and techniques for optimizing deep learning models to achieve faster inference speeds while maintaining accuracy. It includes methods for quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and hardware acceleration for deployment on various platforms, including edge devices and cloud infrastructure.

## Features
- **Model Quantization**: Convert models to lower precision (e.g., INT8, FP16) for reduced memory footprint and improved speed.
- **Pruning and Sparsity**: Remove redundant parameters while preserving model accuracy.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Train smaller student models using larger teacher models for efficient deployment.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilize TensorRT, OpenVINO, ONNX Runtime, and TVM for optimized inference.
- **Benchmarking and Profiling**: Measure model performance in terms of latency, throughput, and memory usage.
- **Deployment on Edge Devices**: Optimize models for deployment on Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, and other embedded systems.
- **Automatic Optimization Pipelines**: Automate model conversion and optimization with predefined scripts.
- **Support for Various Frameworks**: Works with TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, and other deep learning frameworks.
- **Custom Optimization Strategies**: Implement your own optimization techniques and evaluate their effectiveness.

## Installation
```bash
cd model-optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt
